# SVG Logo Maker Project

## What is This Project?

This project is a Node.js application that generates a logo and saves it as an SVG file.

- **Why Did I Make This?**: To improve my skills in Node.js and working with SVGs. This project helped me learn to create a dynamic and customizable logo generator.
- **What's in It?**: The application prompts the user to select a text and background color (from a preset or custom hex) and their desired shape, then provide text for the logo, and finally it saves the generated SVG to a `.svg` file. The generated file can then be viewed in a web browser.
- **What Did I Learn?**: This project helped me learn more about creating command-line applications in Node.js, how to handle user input, and how to generate and manipulate SVG files.
